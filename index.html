      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="static/IMG_8379.JPEG", width="250">
      <p>&emsp; Aloha! My name is Levi Farinas. I was born in Hawaii with a passion for electrical engineering. 
        I grew infatuated with this field from a young age, ever since my parents bought me my first soldering iron.
        As I got older, I read as much as I could about electronics, determined to learn the most I could. 
        Whenever I wasn't busy with school or sports, I enjoyed building electronics projects.
        </p>
        <br><p>
        &emsp; But my life was uprooted with the 2019 eruption of Kilauea.        <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180606014217-kapoho-bay-super-tease.jpg", width="400">
        In one night, my childhood home and most of my possessions were destroyed.
        I was distraught, but I applied myself to studies and sports. I participated in the World Eskrima Kali Arnis Federation (WEKAF) tournament, and became a world champion in stick fighting and knife fighting. Shortly thereafter, I earned my black belt in Taekwondo.
        I went to high school in Pahoa and graduated first in my class at age 16 with a 4.091 GPA. I was selected as my schoolâ€™s academic representative for Salute to the Graduates, and I took numerous college courses during high school.
        But then I hit another roadblock in my goal of studying engineering: Coronavirus. 
        Due to the pandemic, I was unable to enroll at my community college's electronics course. Because of this, I went to school for IT instead. 
        At 18, I graduated from this program with highest honors, a 4.0 GPA, and numerous accolades. I was awarded the prestigous 'E Imi Pono award and was on the Dean's list for every term of my degree.

      <p>
        <br>
        &emsp; But I didn't forget my passion for electronics. During this time, I worked with a team to develop a sexual assault prevention wristband, garnering almost a thousand interested prospects in days. I've created several Japanese language learning tools, including a website and mobile app. 
        As a high school student, I designed and built a weather station for amateur storm watchers to contribute meteorological data to government agencies. 
        I earned the most advanced level of FCC amateur radio certification at 15, and conducted intercontinental radio communications for Red Cross simulated emergency drills. I've designed several new methods for long-distance wireless data transmission and write a blog about new designs for RF hardware, including phased arrays, transceivers, and general electronics. It can be found <a href="https://kh6lf.com">here</a>
        I also wrote a book titled "The Simple Guide to Software Defined Radio", which I will explain more about later.
        After graduating, I plan to obtain a career as an RF engineer, which will allow me to continue developing systems like these to improve the lives of our community.
      </p>  
      <h1>My Goal</h1>
      <p>My lifelong goal is to study electrical engineering. As a child and teen, I devoted countless hours to learning more about this field and trying to help my community.
        I believe nothing will satisfy my curiosity other than obtaining a formal education in this field. I was incredibly fortunate to have been accepted to the UH Manoa College of Engineering, which I will attend next semester.
        But I need your help. I am currently working 3 jobs to raise money for college, yet I've saved barely a third of the cost of a single year to attend. Thus it is with utmost gratitude that I ask for your support in the next chapter of my life.

      <h1>The Book</h1><img src="static/ebook_cover.jpg" width="300">
      <p>I began writing The Simple Guide to Software Defined Radio at age 15. I have been fascinated by the field of radio for a long time, and it perfectly complements my interest in electrical engineering.
        Software Defined Radio is a new paradigm in radio design, utilizing digital signal processing algorithms to demodulate radio signals, instead of purpose-built hardware. This means that this technology can be much more flexible, practical, and cheaper than traditional radios.
        I realized that most literature regarding Software Defined Radio was very academic and abstract, lacking in appeal for beginners. Thus, I sought to consolidate the essentials into a single, small volume that anyone can read.
        It took me a couple years, but I am proud of the result. After readind this book, you will understand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The physics of electromagnetic waves</li>
        <li>RF propagation</li>
        <li>Digital Signal Processing</li>
        <li>ADCs, DACs, FPGAs, and other SDR-related technologies.</li>
        <li>Computer software</li>
        <li>How a radio works (both traditional and software-defined)</li>
        <li>Antennas</li>
        <li>And more!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is my belief that after reading this book, you will possess a solid foundational understanding of this fascinating technology.
        <br>To fund my college education, I am selling copies of this book for $25. When purchasing your book, please ensure that your address is accurate, so that it will be sent to the right place. Thank you very much for your support!
